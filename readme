htmlint
=======

I've decided to make an HTML linter.

This project was created because there was a very
large subset of linting features I felt like wouldn't fit into crest.
I was initially going to add linting issues as warnings, but then realized
warnings suck, and then realized they don't fit the crest philosophy. This is why I
created htmlint, to fix my HTML and add to the crappy static-page toolchain that will
some day grow larger than even I.

My ultimate vision for this tool is for it to be very editor friendly.
The last thing any human being on earth wants is an HTML toolchain, we have enough
problems as it is. My "field test" will be integrating it into my vim environment.
